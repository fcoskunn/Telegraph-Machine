## Goal Statement

The main goal of the project is remaking the telegraph machine with using modern microprocessor and other modern devices. The telegraph machine is used to transmit and receive messages since 1840's until modern communication technologies became widespread. The telegraph machines use Morse code to translate alphabet to machine code. Our telegraph machine will emulate same functionalities. 

#### The Functions of Telegraph Machine:
* Morse code to translate given text. 
* Displays translated text to the user.
* Gives the output with multiple ways like LED, Buzzer, etc. 

### Functional Descriptions
*   Uses buzzer to reflect Morse code to the environment. 
*   Uses LED screen to display the translated text. 
*   Uses keyboard to take Latin input via Virtual Terminal.
*   Uses button to take input as Morse Code.
